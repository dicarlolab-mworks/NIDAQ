    Interface to a `National Instruments <http://www.ni.com>`_ data acquisition
    (DAQ) device
parameters: 
  - 
    name: name
    required: yes
    example: Dev1
    description: |
        Device name.

        Run ``/Applications/National Instruments/NI-DAQmx Base/lsdaq.app`` to
        detect available devices and determine their assigned names.
  - 
    name: update_interval
    required: yes
    example: 3ms
    description: >
        MWorks will poll the device for new input data every ``update_interval``
        microseconds
  - 
    name: analog_input_data_interval
    required: yes
    example: 1ms
    description: >
        Interval between acquired samples on analog input channels
        (microseconds)
  - 
    name: analog_output_data_interval
    required: yes
    example: 1ms
    description: >
        Interval between generated samples on analog output channels
        (microseconds)
  - 
    name: analog_read_timeout
    example: 3ms
    description: |
        Maximum time to wait for a single update's worth of analog input samples
        (microseconds).  If the samples are not received in the allotted time,
        issue an error message.

        If omitted, defaults to `update_interval`_.
  - 
    name: analog_output_enabled
    default: 'YES'
    description: |
        Controls whether the device performs output on configured analog
        output `voltage <NIDAQ Analog Output Voltage Channel>` and
        `voltage waveform <NIDAQ Analog Output Voltage Waveform Channel>`
        channels.

        If this parameter is set to a variable name, then setting the variable
        to ``NO`` while the experiment is running will stop analog output, and
        subsequently setting the variable to ``YES`` will restart analog output.
        Hence, it provides a means to start and stop analog output independently
        of other input and output tasks.
  - 
    name: assume_multiplexed_adc
    default: 'YES'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, MWorks assumes that all analog input channels share a single
        analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and adjusts sample timestamps
        accordingly.  If ``NO``, MWorks assumes that each analog input channel
        has its own ADC and that samples for all channels are acquired
        simultaneously.

    Generates a periodic analog output voltage signal on a `NIDAQ Device`.

    All waveform parameters (`waveform`_, `period`_, `offset`_, `amplitude`_,
    and `mean`_) can be modified at run time.  Changes take effect after output
    is stopped and restarted, either by `stopping <Stop IO Device>` and
    `restarting <Start IO Device>` the device, or by setting the device's
    ``analog_output_enabled`` parameter to ``NO`` and then ``YES``.

name: NIDAQ Digital Output Channel
signature: iochannel/nidaq_digital_output
isa: NIDAQ Digital Channel
description: |
    Digital output channel on a `NIDAQ Device`.

    Supports up to 32 lines on a single port.  Each line has an associated
    parameter (e.g. `line0`_) that specifies the variable from which to read the
    state of the line (0 or 1).  `Assigning <Assign Variable>` a value to the
    variable causes the line's state to be changed immediately.

    Also supports multi-bit word output via the `word`_ and `word_lines`_
    parameters.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: word
    description: >
        Variable from which to read multi-bit output words.  `Assigning <Assign
        Variable>` a value to the variable causes the state of the lines
        specified in `word_lines`_ to be changed immediately.
  - 
    name: word_lines
    example: ['1,2,3', '4:7', '1,4:6,7']
    description: |
        Lines used to output the individual bits of multi-bit words. The first
        line receives the least significant bit, the last line the most
        significant.

        Lines used for word output cannot also be controlled independently.
        Attempting to assign a value to the parameter associated with a line
        number included here will generate a warning.
